1. Grade Checker
Take a score as input and print the grade based on the following:
90+ : "A"
80-89 : "B"
70-79 : "C"
60-69 : "D"
Below 60 : "F"
here we used a basic if else statement to carry out marks and all.
Code:
x = int(input("Please enter your score: "))
if x>=90:
    print("A")
elif x>80:
    print("B")
elif x>70:
    print("C")
elif x>=60:
    print("D")
elif x<60:
    print("F")

2 Student Grades
Create a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are their grades. Allow the user to:
Add a new student and grade.
Update an existing student’s grade.
Print all student grades.
Used dictionary and basic operations. Using if else:
Code:
grades = {"Arun":"A", "Varun":"C", "Tarun":"B" } #grades dictionary with student, grade key value pairs
grades["Tina"]="A" # New student Tine with grade A
grades["Tarun"]="F" # Existing student Tarun grade change
for i, v in grades.items():
    print(i," ", v)

3.Write to a File
Write a program to create a text file and write some content to it.
Using file functions like write and open.
Code:
f = open('TextFile.txt', 'w')
f.write('File Name TextFile.txt\n')
f.write("First line\n more lines .\n")
f.close()
g = open('TextFile.txt', 'r+')
x = g.read()
print (x)
f.close()


4. Read from a File
We used open in read mode and file.read to read and print to display.
Code:
f = open('TextFile.txt', 'r+')
x= f.read()
print(x)
f.close()
